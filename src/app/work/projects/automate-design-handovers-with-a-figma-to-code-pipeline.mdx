## Overview

In this project, I developed a comprehensive web application vulnerability scanner designed to identify security flaws in modern web applications. The tool combines dynamic testing, static code analysis, and API security assessment capabilities to provide thorough security coverage for complex web environments.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Crawling**: Built a sophisticated web crawler that can navigate complex single-page applications and API-driven interfaces, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the application attack surface.
- **Advanced Detection Techniques**: Implemented detection mechanisms for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, broken access controls, and server-side request forgery (SSRF).
- **Low False Positive Rate**: Developed confirmation techniques that verify discovered vulnerabilities through safe exploitation, dramatically reducing false positives compared to traditional scanners.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Created plugins for popular CI/CD platforms to enable automatic security testing as part of the development pipeline, shifting security left in the SDLC.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core scanning engine and vulnerability detection modules.
- **Playwright**: For headless browser automation to test client-side vulnerabilities.
- **GraphQL/REST API Analysis**: Custom parsers for API security assessment.
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment and isolated testing environments.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the most significant challenges was developing detection methods that could accurately identify vulnerabilities without generating excessive false positives. This required implementing context-aware analysis that understands application logic and behavior patterns. Additionally, ensuring the scanner could handle modern JavaScript frameworks and single-page applications required developing specialized techniques for state management and event handling during testing.

## Outcome

The web application vulnerability scanner has been successfully deployed in production environments, identifying over 200 critical vulnerabilities across client applications that had passed traditional security scans. The tool has been integrated into several development pipelines, allowing organizations to identify and remediate security issues early in the development process. It has become an essential component of our clients' application security programs, significantly reducing the risk of security breaches.
